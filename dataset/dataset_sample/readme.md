Human-Robot Dialogue Corpus for Turn-taking Prediction
======================================================

We gave several dialogue samples in the attachment, including audio files and transcription file. Different sessions were titled seperately with the format like "Session1". The dialogues are in Chinese, for understanding, English translations are also provided (marked by "\\"). IPUs are marked out by {}, and the turn-taking labels are also annotated (e.g., "endpointing-switch", "endpointing-hold", "barge-in-switch", "barge-in-hold" ). For each utterance, the timestamp was also shown at the beginning of each line for detecting the utterance boundary from audio. Besides, the role of speaker is marked by either A or B.
